All terminal commands must assume execution from the repository root.
Do not run commands from $HOME.
If needed, `cd` to the project directory first.

Always run commands from the project root.
If unsure, first run the bootstrap script.

Always run `./scripts/bootstrap` before running other commands.

Always run `npm test` in separate terminal sessions, not in the same one where `npm run dev` was executed.
